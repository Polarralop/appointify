## Appointify
Appointify is an application intended to track upcoming reservations, **appointments** and any more urgent details!

It currently does **NOT** have:
- Saves
- A working calendar (although the one there is kinda cool :D)
- A visual of one's week with time blocks
- Conflict Detection
- Sort by time

It **does** have:
- An organized (subjective) view of the upcoming events submitted.
- Notifications (albeit via browser only) whenever an event is within one hour. (Sent every minute.)
- Deletion of events.
- Cool-ish animation for the button that adds events!

This is a very amateur project; many lessons were learned and I'm glad we did it. Progress, even at just a crawl is **still progress**.
